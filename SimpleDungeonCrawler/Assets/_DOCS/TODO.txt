TODO:

    - We no longer want to have a die message. Instead, establish "Checkpoints" 
      based on the current area the player died, then spawn them at that checkpoint.
    - Added DialogueSystem

    - Make a branch to change build to Android and implement Mobile controls.
    - Fix the GameCredit scene.  I would like it to fade out before cutting to MainMenu
