TODO:

    - Conditional dialogue seems to be working for HasItem condition, 
      I'd like to implement the same concept for items. Perhaps create another player component
      that tracks objects it has seen(Items, Doors, Teleporters)
      It could simply be a circleCollider flagged as trigger, then when any of the formentioned 
      things enter it, it is added to the list.  Then the condition could check if it is in the list.

    - Some systems could share the same handlers.  IE: EventTrigger and Interactable
      Think of a way that they can share the behaviour!
      Perhaps a BaseHandler class that all Handlers can implement?

    - Test the LoadNextLevel gamestate

    - Added DialogueSystem: So add some triggers to start some dialogue.  
      IE: when a player comes to a door and doesnt have a key, "Something sort of funny"
      or when they come across any new "mechanic" in the game.

    - Add a Dash mechanic to the game that consumes stamina
    - Change the end of game object to next level

    - Make a branch to change build to Android and implement Mobile controls.
    - Fix the GameCredit scene.  I would like it to fade out before cutting to MainMenu
