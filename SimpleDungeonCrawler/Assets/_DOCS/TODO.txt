TODO:

    - Added DialogueSystem: So add some triggers to start some dialogue.  
      IE: when a player comes to a door and doesnt have a key, "Something sort of funny"
      or when they come across any new "mechanic" in the game.

    - Add a Dash mechanic to the game that consumes stamina
    - Change the end of game object to next level

    - When player is hit, a "damage" text should be spawned, but it should be random
      words like, "Ouch!"  "UGH!" "DOH!" "WTF!"

    - Make a branch to change build to Android and implement Mobile controls.
    - Fix the GameCredit scene.  I would like it to fade out before cutting to MainMenu
