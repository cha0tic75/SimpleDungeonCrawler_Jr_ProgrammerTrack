TODO:

    - Make sure the other Level scenes are using the new "Collider Notifier system" for damage walls
    - Some systems could share the same handlers.  IE: EventTrigger and Interactable
      Think of a way that they can share the behaviour!
      Perhaps a BaseHandler class that all Handlers can implement?

    - Test the LoadNextLevel gamestate

    - Added DialogueSystem: So add some triggers to start some dialogue.  
      IE: when a player comes to a door and doesnt have a key, "Something sort of funny"
      or when they come across any new "mechanic" in the game.

    - Add a Dash mechanic to the game that consumes stamina
    - Change the end of game object to next level

    - Make a branch to change build to Android and implement Mobile controls.
    - Fix the GameCredit scene.  I would like it to fade out before cutting to MainMenu
