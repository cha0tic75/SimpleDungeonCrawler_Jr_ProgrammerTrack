TODO:

    - Change the Settings page in menu so that it adjusts the mixer volume and not the AudioSource volume
    - Create an Object Pooler system for Particles and DamageText

    - Added DialogueSystem: So add some triggers to start some dialogue.  
      IE: when a player comes to a door and doesnt have a key, "Something sort of funny"
      or when they come across any new "mechanic" in the game.

    - Add a Dash mechanic to the game that consumes stamina
    - Change the end of game object to next level

    - Make a branch to change build to Android and implement Mobile controls.
    - Fix the GameCredit scene.  I would like it to fade out before cutting to MainMenu
