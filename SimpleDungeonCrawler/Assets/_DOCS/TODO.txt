TODO:
08/21/2022:
    - Re apply the Damage Dealer to the Tilemap collider
    - We no longer want to have a die message. Instead, establish "Checkpoints" 
      based on the current area the player died, then spawn them at that checkpoint.


    - Make a branch to change build to Android and implement Mobile controls.
    - Fix the GameCredit scene.  I would like it to fade out before cutting to MainMenu
